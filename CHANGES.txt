        * Locks timeout if they havn't been pinged in a configurable expiry time
            * Ensure deadlocks can't happen due to parts of the distributed architecture failing

2013-10-10 Version 2.5.0

    * The MemSQL collect plugin now flushes data using a thread
        * this helps stabalize insert timing
        * keeps collectd from falling behind by 40ms+ during a flush
    * Don't send diskinfo from the collectd plugin, the df plugin is now required for Ops

2013-10-07 Version 2.4.0

    * Added a useful class called SQLStepQueue
        * Requires MemSQL 2.5 to work due to using JSON under the hood.

        * Each enqueued item can be started, multiple steps can be executed on it, and then it can be stoped
        * Timing information for each step is stored on the item's execution row
